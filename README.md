# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Alphabet Soup is a philanthropic organization is dedicated to helping organizations that protect the environment and people's well-being and unify the world.

Alphabet Soup has raised and donated over $10 billion in the past twenty years. This money has been used to invest in life-saving technologies and organizations active in reforestation around the world. Each donation needs to be assessed for its impact and the recipient need to be vetted by  organization's data analysts. This makes sure the organization's money is being used effectively. Unfortunately, not every donation is impactful. In some instances, an organization takes the money and will disappear. As a result the organization's president has asked their data analyst to predict which organizations are worth donating too and which are too high-risk. 

The organization's data analyst has been tasked to help create a mathematical data-driven solution that can do this accurately. Given the nature of the task, the problem is too complex for statistical and machine learning models. Instead a deep-neural network needs to be designed. This model will evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision-making result.

Therefore, we have been tasked to help with the design and train the models using the Python Tensorflow library. We should employ statistics and machine learning to help test and optimize the models. We strive to create a robust deep learning neural network that is capable of interpreting large complex datasets. This model will help Alphabet Soup determine which organization should receive donations.

In this undertaking we need to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

 Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results 

Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


## Summary 

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
